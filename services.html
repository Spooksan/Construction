                                <p>Demolition is the removal of the existing home from the lot where a new home will be built. Lots such as these are referred to as a brown field sites because they have previously been built on. If a home is being built
                                    on a lot that has not previously had a home built on it, the lot is referred to as a greenfield site. Typically during the demolition phase of a project, an excavator removes the old home and the debris is sorted and
                                    either recycled or sent to the landfill. Drywall, metal and wood products can be recycled.</p>
                                <p>After the existing home has been removed, site clearing can take place. Site clearing typically involves the removal of non-protected trees as well as other vegetation and structures such as sheds, decks, carports and other
                                    detached structures located on the building lot.</p>

                                <h3>Footings</h3>
                                <p>Footings are an important part of foundation construction. They are typically made of concrete with rebar reinforcement that has been poured into an excavated trench. The purpose of footings is to support the foundation
                                    and prevent settling. Footings are especially important in areas with troublesome soils.</p>
                                <p>The construction of footings is best left to the pros that can assess the soil conditions and decide on the proper depth and width for the footings as well as the proper placement. The dimensions of footings also depend
                                    on the size and type of structure that will be built. Placement of footings is crucial to provide the proper support for the foundation and ultimately the structure.</p>
                                <h3>Stub Columns</h3>
                                <p>We know that column stands on the footing. but when coming to the stub column. It won’t have any footing. The column stands on the slab or beam.</p>
                                <p>For making you clear, here I am giving an example, for suppose you constructed a house with a capacity of 50 members so according to the members using building you design a water tank. Suddenly due to the scarcity of land
                                    building is using by 90 members so initially, you are provided one tank which will sufficient to 50 members. Now, you have to provide another tank to cover all the 90 members. But you constructed a building with the
                                    design of only one tank but additionally, another tank is added inorder to bear that load another column is added beneath the tank and it rests on either beam or column.</p>
                                <h3>Tie Beams</h3>
                                <p>The beam which connects two or more columns/rafters in a roof/ roof truss or in any height above floor level is called tie beam. Tie beams are mainly provided in roof truss and at plinth level. These beams do not convey
                                    any floor loads and only act as length breaker for columns where the floor height is unusually high.</p>
                                <p>PURPOSE OF TIE BEAM:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To carry axial compression.</li>
                                    <li>To transfer the rafter’s load to the column.</li>
                                    <li>To prevent columns from buckling.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Solid concrete blocks are commonly used, which are heavy in weight and manufactured from dense aggregate. They are very strong and provides good stability to the structures. So for large work of masonry like for load bearing
                                    walls these solid blocks are preferable. They are available in large sizes compared to bricks. So, it takes less time to construct concrete masonry than brick masonry.</p>

                                <p>In construction, backfilling is the process of replacing or reusing the soil that is removed during building construction to strengthen and support a structure’s foundation or any other structural member.</p>
                                <h3>Bitumen Paint</h3>
                                <p>Paint is a solvent based, general purpose, bituminous black paint for waterproofing and weather protecting steelwork, asphalt and wood, concrete and potable water tanks. When dry it forms an odourless and taint free bitumen
                                    film. Paint forms a waterproof, weatherproof, corrosion resistant protective coating.</p>
                                <h3>Construction Polythene Sheet</h3>
                                <p>Construction Poly Sheets are mainly used for the construction sector. It helps in separating the dry ground and the wet concrete. So that concrete can take its own time for dry and avoids the possibilities of cracks and
                                    other damages.</p>

                                <p>The structural components of a building constructed above the ground level constitute the superstructure. </p>
                                <p>The basic components of a building’s superstructure are columns, beams, slab and wall. These components safely transfer the dead loads, live loads and other loads to the substructure (foundation and plinth) which further
                                    distributes it to the underlying earth.</p>
                                <h3>Columns</h3>
                                <p>The column is a vertical structural element that carries compressive loads. This is one of the critical structural element in any building structure whose failure can result in progressive collapse.</p>
                                <h3>Beams</h3>
                                <p>A beam is a horizontal structural element with a specific depth and width running with a span. It withstands vertical loads, bending moments and shear forces.</p>
                                <p>The loads coming on the beams are transferred to the beam endpoints where it is supported. This is then transferred to the columns or the beam supporting structural elements.</p>
                                <h3>Slabs</h3>
                                <p>Slabs are horizontal structural elements that serve the purpose of floor, roofs or ceilings. These are flat surfaces with top and bottom face parallel to each other.</p>
                                <p>Slabs are supported mainly by columns, beams, walls or the ground. The depth of the slab is very small when compared to its depth.</p>

                                <p>Walls are vertical surfaces constructed in continuance that divide the enclosed spaced. Walls can be constructed either by means of masonry or by means of concrete. Walls take up the load from the beams, the slabs or the
                                    roof above.</p>
                                <p>As the name “Wall Finishes” itself suggests that it is finish given to the wall to enhance the interior or exterior look of the structure. Wall finishes used for the interiors are quite delicate and need maintenance. The
                                    new contemporary trend has brought about great deal of increase in the usage of various types of wall finishes for the aesthetic purpose in the interiors and exteriors.</p>

                                <p>The floor is defined as a finished horizontal surface of a building or a room where people walk. Any floor has two main components- sub-floor and floor cover. The sub-floor is constructed to support the imposed loads coming
                                    over it. This component imparts strength and stability for the floor structure. A floor cover or flooring is a suitable floor finish provided in the form of tiles, granite, marbles, concrete, etc.</p>
                                <p>A floor finish is a liquid which is applied to a resilient tile floor and dries to a hard, durable and smooth film. This film is about the thickness of waxed paper and is expected to protect and extend the life of the floor
                                    while providing an attractive appearance and slip resistant surface.</p>

                                <p> joinery is the method by which two or more pieces of wood are connected. Joinery can involve simple gluing, nailing, or screwing of the two pieces of wood but it can be as complicated as using very intricate joints. While
                                    the primary purpose of joinery is to hold wood together strongly and securely, it can also be a decorative feature of the project in which the joinery is used.</p>
                                <p>Joinery is an important part of most woodworking and it is found in furniture, cabinetry, windows and doors, flooring, and much more. It is a specialist area of carpentry and as such, you would get a specialist joiner or

                                <h3>Ventilation</h3>
                                <p>A ventilation system can certainly help to purify the air inside a space, but won’t actually cool the room down.</p>
                                <p>An air ventilation system works by mixing the air inside a space with the air outside of the building, then releasing it back into the room. The end result of this process is that the quality of air in the room becomes
                                    much better.</p>
                                <h3>Air Conditioning</h3>
                                <p>On the contrary, an air conditioning system does not use any external source to cool or heat a room. An air con system will take the air from inside a space, heat it or cool it, depending on the setting you have the system
                                    on, then recycle the same air back into the room.</p>
                                <p>It is a common misconception that there is hardly any difference between air conditioning and ventilation. However, understanding such differences will help you to make a better-informed decision.</p>

                                <p>A garage door is a large door on a garage that opens either manually or by an electric motor (a garage door opener). Garage doors are frequently large enough to accommodate automobiles and other vehicles. Small garage doors
                                    may be made in a single panel that tilts up and back across the garage ceiling. Larger doors are usually made in several jointed panels that roll up on tracks across the garage ceiling, or into a roll above the doorway.
                                    The operating mechanism is spring-loaded or counterbalanced to offset the weight of the door and reduce human or motor effort required to operate the door. Less commonly, some garage doors slide or swing horizontally.
                                    Doors are made of wood, metal, or fiberglass, and may be insulated to prevent heat loss.</p>

                                <p>Wardrobe cabinets are similar to closets. The difference being that closets are built into the wall. Wardrobe cabinets are external. Sometimes referred to as an armoire, wardrobe cabinets are added to bedrooms or anywhere
                                    extra storage is needed for clothing. Other items such as linens, towels, shoes and coats can be stored in this type of cabinet. Basic wardrobe cabinets are simple, with options for doors, drawers or open shelves.</p>
                                <p>Wardrobe dimensions depend on the builder or designer. Most wardrobe cabinets typically are 24 inches deep, but can be as narrow as 18 or even 12 inches in depth. Height also depends on application, but standard height
                                    is usually no more than 72 inches. Width varies anywhere from between 24 inches to more than 96 inches. There is no real standard for wardrobe cabinet measurements, other than they fit into the space needed. Once the
                                    dimensions are established, allowances for doors, drawers and hanging space is determined.</p>

                                    conceal the associated plumbing as well as providing much needed storage. The benchtop is also an important part of the bathroom vanity and benchtops are available in stone, reconstituted stone, cement, wood, laminate,
                                    and more. Bathroom vanities are made from different materials but they are usually moisture resistant or waterproof, due to the fact that the bathroom is the biggest wet area in the home.</p>

                                    by controlling the portal, (doorway). Conventionally, it is a panel that fits into the portal of a building, room, or vehicle. Doors are commonly made of a material suited to the task of which it is to perform. Doors
                                    are commonly attached by hinges within the portal but can be moved by other means such as slides or counterbalancing.</p>

                                    The origin of the word is the Late Latin pergula, referring to a projecting eave. As a type of gazebo, it may also be an extension of a building or serve as protection for an open terrace or a link between pavilions.

                                <p>When used effectively, radios are an excellent way to improve safety and productivity on the job when compared to yelling and using hand signals. The jobsite contains countless hazards, and injury prevention is a major
                                    concern for all site managers. How many injuries could be prevented if a warning was seen or heard in time? Good construction communications practices can reduce injury and mistakes—saving money and time in the process.</p>
                                <p>Two-way radios are very scalable. It is relatively simple to equip as many users as desired, and a message from a single person is immediately heard by the entire radio group, which is a real advantage for communications
                                    from supervisors to construction crews.</p>

                                <p>A distributed antenna system (DAS) is a way to deal with isolated spots of poor coverage inside a large building by installing a network of relatively small antennas throughout the building to serve as repeaters.</p>
                                <p>The antennas are physically connected to a central controller which is connected to the wireless carrier network’s base station. Because distributed antenna systems operate on RF spectrum licensed to wireless carriers,
                                    an enterprise cannot undertake a DAS deployment on its own without involving at least one carrier. </p>
                                <p>Distributed antenna systems are transparent to mobile devices, providing both voice and data services to mobile devices just like any tower on a cellular network. Densely populated indoor spaces such as shopping malls,
                                    medical centers and high-rise buildings are all good candidates for DAS deployments.</p>
